# CSCI-104 Written Homework #1

## Problem 1: Runtime Analysis

In Big-$Î˜$ notation, analyze the running time of the following four pieces of code/pseudo-code. Describe it as a function of the input (here, $n$).

### Part (a)
  
```C++
void f1(int n)
{
    int i=2;
    while(i < n){
        /* do something that takes O(1) time */
        i = i*i;
    }
}
```

- Since $i$ multiply itself every iteration, it grows in the rate of $2^{2^k}$ after $k^{th}$ iteration. Also, because $i \le n$, by solving $2^{2^i}=n$, we can get $i\le \log \log n$, so the answer is $\Theta(\log \log n)$.

### Part (b)

```C++
void f2(int n)
{
    for(int i=1; i <= n; i++){
        if( (i % (int)sqrt(n)) == 0){
            for(int k=0; k < pow(i,3); k++) {
              /* do something that takes O(1) time */
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- The inner loop takes $\Theta(i^3)$ time, and the inner loop only executes when `i % (int)sqrt(n)) == 0`, which happens at most $n$ times. Thus, overal it is
  $$\Theta(n+ ((\sqrt n)^3 + (2\sqrt n)^3 + \dots +(\sqrt n\sqrt n)^3))$$ 
  $$=\Theta(n+ ((\sqrt n)^3 \cdot (1^3+2^3+\dots+(\sqrt n)^3)))$$
  $$=\Theta(n+ ((\sqrt n)^3 \cdot \frac{n^2 + n + 2n\sqrt{n}}{4}))$$
  $$=\Theta((\sqrt n)^3\cdot n^2)$$
  $$=\Theta(n^{7\over 2})$$

### Part (c)

```C++
for(int i=1; i <= n; i++){
  for(int k=1; k <= n; k++){
    if( A[k] == i){
      for(int m=1; m <= n; m=m+m){
        // do something that takes O(1) time
        // Assume the contents of the A[] array are not changed
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- The outer loop has runtime of $\Theta(n)$, and the inner loop has runtime of $\Theta(\log n)$ since $m$ doubles every iteration.
- For the middle loop and the `if` condition, through out the execution, at most $n$ times the `if` statement is true, as it is finding how many numbers in `A[]` is between $1$ and $n$.
- Thus, the total time complexity is the times that the `if` statement is true times the complexity of inner loop: $n \cdot \Theta(\log n) = \Theta(n \log n)$.

### Part (d)

```C++
int f (int n)
{
  int *a = new int [10];
  int size = 10;
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i ++) 
     {
        if (i == size)
          {  
             int newsize = 3*size/2;
             int *b = new int [newsize];
             for (int j = 0; j < size; j ++) b[j] = a[j];
             delete [] a;
             a = b;
             size = newsize;
          }
        a[i] = i*i;
     }
}
```

- The outer loop has a complexity of $\Theta (n)$, and in the inner loop, it performs a conditional sizing that if the the index is out of range and resize to 1.5x the previous size.
- The number of times of resizing is proportional to $\log n$ and thus the total complexity of resizing will be $\sum_{i=0}^{\log n} 10\cdot \left ( 3\over 2\right )^i = 10\Theta\left(\left(3\over 2\right)^{\log n}\right) = \Theta(n)$.
- Overall, the runtime combined with the outer and inner loop is $\Theta(n)$.

## Problem 2: Linked List Recursion Tracing

### Question a

What linked list is returned if llrec is called with the input linked lists `in1 = 1,2,3,4` and `in2 = 5,6`?

**Answer:**
The Function Execution in the following order:

1. **First Call:** `llrec(1, 5)`
   - Set `1 -> next` to the result of `llrec(5, 2)`.

2. **Second Call:** `llrec(5, 2)`
   - Set `5 -> next` to the result of `llrec(2, 6)`.

3. **Third Call:** `llrec(2, 6)`
   - Set `2 -> next` to the result of `llrec(6, 3)`.

4. **Fourth Call:** `llrec(6, 3)`
   - Set `6 -> next` to the result of `llrec(3, nullptr)`.

5. **Fifth Call:** `llrec(3, nullptr)`
   - `in2` is `nullptr`, so return `in1 = 3`.

   After this call:
   - `6 -> next` points to `3`.
   - `2 -> next` points to `6`, which points to `3`.
   - `5 -> next` points to `2`, which points to `6 -> 3`.
   - `1 -> next` points to `5`, which points to `2 -> 6 -> 3`.

6. **Final Answer:** After the Fifth Call, the returned linked list `in1 = 1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 6 -> 3`.

### Question b

What linked list is return if llrec is called with the input linked lists `in1 = nullptr` and `in2 = 2`?

**Answer:** the programm will go throgh the first `if` statement and return `in2` which is `2`.
